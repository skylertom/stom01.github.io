			<p> I'm a junior at Tufts University studying computer science. I previously had no experience in programming despite growing up in the heart of the Silicon Valley, but I've since been converted. I like computer science for the logical way in which code is designed and the ability to create and improve so many things in everyday life. I'm also interested in psychology and design, and I hope to learn about front-end programming to help users navigate intuitively. </p>
			<p>In my free time I play ultimate frisbee with the Tufts E-men, read books, and eat/bake food. I enjoy reading about social psychology, ergonomics, sociology, and economics (and especially books that combine these topics).</p>
