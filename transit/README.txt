1. In firefox, the geolocation (get current position function) and adding the line doesn't work. I've spent 6 hours trying to debug this (got the map to show up), but haven't figured it out. In IE, and chrome everything works perfectly (also works fine on mobile).
2. I have collaborated with: George Brown, Siddartha Prasaad
3. I've spent 18 hours + 6 hours trying to debug the firefox issue
